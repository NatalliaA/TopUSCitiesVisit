# TopUSCitiesVisit
Web page with a photo gallery and a distance calculator

<h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>The main purpose of this project was to build a responsive webpage with photos - Top Cities to Visit in the USA. The webpage shows photos from seven large American cities using the same resizable layout for different devices. The website also includes an embedded Google map and a distance calculator to estimate and display the driving route and distance between two cities.</p>   
                            <h4>Developing Tools:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML5</li>
                                <li>CSS Grid</li>
                                <li>Javascript</li>
                                <li>Google Maps API</li>                   
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The responsive layout of the photo gallery is achieved with the CSS Grid. The layout of the photos remains the same for different screen sizes - one large photo surrounded by five small photos - and only changes in its size.</li>
                                <li>The embedded Google map demonstrates the use of JavaScript for creating a distance calculator. The user can fill in two locations by manually typing or using the autocomplete feature. The search result will be displayed as a route on the map with the drive details (from, to, driving distance in miles and drive time).</li>
                            </ul>
